<p>Notes: Used div.fusion-text a as a selector.  Once all of the elements pertaining to
          to that selector were complied in a list with .nodes(), we used the mapping method
          to get the inner text of each and return it as an element.

<p>Notes: Similar method applied here to get final result.  The hardest part for us
  was picking the right selector so we did not include the last "course descriptions" li element at the
  end of the div we were trying to select.  Ended up using "div#main > ul:first-of-type a" the key part being the > selector which
  allowed us to only get the a elements of the first ul in the div.

<p>Notes: This one was a little unique in the fact that it contained both link elements and regular text all within different tables.
          We ended up finding that if you get the td elements in a list and retrieve their inner text,, the a element will be disregarded.
          We also had to add an additional function to try to remove some of the empty td elements from the list.  While the function was partially
          successful, 2 empty cells remained in the new list and a cell with a unique value.  To solve this perhaps additional logic operators could be employed.

<p>Notes: This one was pretty straight forward, all classes were placed in a convenient div from which the a elements could easily be scraped from.
