<h1>Frequency Analysis of Bookworm Penguin's Grades</h1>
<br  />
<h3>Generating my histograms</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Covnverted my JSON to a CSV using https://json-csv.com/</li>
  <li>Copy and pasted Bookworm's data to a seperate sheet</li>
  <li>Used the histogram tool under the data analysis package to analyze data with a specified bin width and bin number</li>
  <li>Adjusted y-axis to be consistent across all 3 charts</li>
  <li>Updated x-axis to reflect the boundraies of each bin</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Histograms</h3>
<p> After briefly looking at the 3 graphs you can tell that the quiz grades had a bigger effect on the distrubution of overall scores, not only does the shape of the
    quiz grade histogram resemble that of the of the all grades histogram, but the frequencies in each bin appear simliar.  While the HW histogram is more normally distrubuted
    its frequencies are not high enough to effect the the all grades histogram as drastically.
