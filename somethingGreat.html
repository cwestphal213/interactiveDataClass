<h3>Why is visualization effective?</h3>
<p> Visualization is effective because it allows the reader to both receive information about the truth and visualize it.  By mapping data into visual properties, you can perceive it better than you would if it were flat out told to you.  in the World Atlas of Language Structures visualization, the Puff Puff team takes complex linguistical data and effectively maps it to the larger world.  Additionally, the charts further down on the page allow you to see the relative size of each family and their relationship to one another.

<h3>What are the more effective ways to encode data for perceptual tasks?</h3>
<p> You need to encode the data to direct the viewer towards a task that will lead them to discover the basic data that is behind your code.  This all depends on what you are trying to focus on.  For something as macro-focused as all the world’s languages, a physical map is certainly appropriate.  The authors of the WALS visualization want you to know about each languages’ location and how it is effected by and related to the languages around it.  I also found the visualization of the ten major religious families and how they are all interconnected to one another to be incredibly effective as I found myself following the movements of the language groups across the map.

<p> For a similar data topic, I found data on the languages spoken within Chicago.  Because the data is more locally based, I did not feel a map would be the best possible way to portray the data.  Working within Excel’s frame work, I decided to go with a line chart to best show all the data within the population.  By using a line chart, I hope to display all of the languages but also have viewers focus on the more popular languages as they loom above the rest of them.

<h3>What are trade-offs that Cairo asks us to consider when building a visualization?</h3>
<p> As Cairo states in his earlier chapters, the purpose of visualization is to allow as many people to access and interpret your data as possible.  To do this, you must consider what you are trying to show and how it effects each person.  I think the WALS visualization does a good job navigating the spaces between each of these issues.  The maps, while pleasing to the eye, also allow the viewer to gain tangible information from while also distilling large macro data into smaller digestible charts as well.
