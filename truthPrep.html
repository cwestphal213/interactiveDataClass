<h1>Cairo on the TRUTH</h1>

<p>One of the more interesting points that Cairo brings up in Chapter 3 was the about how the brain analyzes data; first by looking for patterns, then creating narratives to explain these patterns, and then analyzing other data based on these narratives.  I really liked the example he provided with Ukraine where it provided three maps where is showed Presidential Election results, Native Language, and locations of protests.  From first glance it is very easy to assume that the country can easily be divided into two halves, the western half being pro-Ukrainian and the Eastern half being pro-Russian.  From this data, one would be quick to assume that the conflict stems from ethnic divide, however the second diagram reveals the divide to be much more complex than that showing different divides through different regions.
</p>
<p>Additionally, Cairo makes a point that in order to portray data accurately and effectively, data visualist must employ small lies/simplifications in their models for viewers to better understand the truth, as having all the data in front of you at once is hard to decipher.  I cannot really think of an specific example of a time where I used a lie to tell the truth better but I could see using one to help people find their own mis-understandings like the different learning techniques used by the people in the videos we watched at the beginning of the course.  If you are teaching something to someone in a deductive method, and they get something wrong in a chain of the logic, it might be beneficial to continue to carry on so that they can see the mistake they made as the problem arises.
