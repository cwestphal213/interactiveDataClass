<h1>Freedom of the Press Data Exploration</h1>
<p>
My topic is to cover the freedom of information worldwide through a number of different parameters.  The first that I have chosen is the <a href='https://cpj.org/data/'>Committee to Protect Journalists</a> database of journalist killed.  The data has a lot of functionality and can be used to distinguish whether the journalists were killed based on country, year, job, and motive of killing, all of which will be useful as I construct my visualization.
</p>
<p>
The next database I will pull from is the <a href='https://freedomhouse.org/report-types/freedom-press'>Freedom House Freedom of Press Report</a>.  Based on consistent metrics, the organization assigns values to each country based on the level of free press allowed for in each country.  This will be useful in quantifying the relative freedom of press in each country which I can then use to compare back to the number of journalist deaths.
