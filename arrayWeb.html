<h1> List of Animals Excersise</h1>
<body>
  <p>
    Brief Explanation: Our solution is divided up into 3 parts after making the list, all of which can be seen if you
    look at our java script source code.  First we create document an give it an id so that it can be called back later.
    Then we created a function that takes a sinlge string as an arg, adds it to a list element, and adds that list
    element to the list defined in the last step.  Lastly we run a for loop to run this for every item inside the animal list.
