<h1>Force Diagrams</h1>
<p>
  I found force-directed diagrams to be a bit confusing but to my understanding the charts show the relative strength of different “nodes” relationships to one another using different values in “links.”  A good example that helped frame my thinking on force-diagrams was this example that uses measures the relationship between different game of thrones characters by the number of times that they speak to each other.  The source is in below.

  Going along with a similar theme, I think one good data set to use would be the amount of times world leaders of a certain country mention each other in speeches.  The chart would give viewers a good idea of the relative focus of each country and whether their focus is being reciprocated by the strength of their bond.

  In a different vein, I think an interesting set of data that force directed layouts could also explore is the number of common ancestors shared amongst modern ethnic groups.  The links would show the relative connectedness of each group and how they are related to others.

  Lastly, a cool data set to explore with force diagrams would be to try to understand the relationship between fortune 500 companies and the industries that they share.  This could help viewers to intuitively see how each company competes with one another and the markets that they share.
