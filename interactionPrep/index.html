<h2>D3-able Elements in the Website</h2>
<h3>Hover color change</h3>
<p>This feature is a nice addition to the graph and gives it some dynamism that appeals to the eye.  
  To implement this into d3, I would use the .on method a function that sets the atrribute fill to a the new color.
</p>
<h3>Hover tool tips</h3>
<p>To do this I would use a simliar .on method with mouseover passed as the first argument 
  and for the second function to place and size the box, and go into the data set retrieve the name 
  of the company and the percentage of market share, and display them in the box.  Rather than have 
  select the bars on the graph for the rectangle, I would have to find a way to select the entire row whigh could probably be achieved with g elements.
</p>
<h3>Bars extending outward</h3>
<p>When you first open the box in the webpage, you will notice that the boxes slowly open.  In d3, I would implement this by adding the 
  .transition atrrtibute when drawing in my rectangles to the DOM
