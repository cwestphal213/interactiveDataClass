<h2>Common Ideas Between Mayuko and CSC 265 Syllabus</h2>
<p>What I really liked about Mayuko’s video was the emphasis on computer science and software engineering jobs as much more people focused and collaborative then people give it credit for.  One of the expectations that she counters in the video is the idea that software engineering is a lonesome job.  In reality, Mayuko explains that software engineering actually requires a lot of teamwork and collaboration between you and your team to make sure that the end product meets everyone’s expectations.  This is of course reflected in the syllabus by the emphasis on partnership when working on class assignment.  Not only do you have to be good at coding, but also problem solving together as a group.  Like in an actual software engineering job, students will have to work together and play to each other’s strengths and weaknesses to complete the assignment to the specifications necessary. </p>
<p>Additionally, Mayuko stresses the importance of peer reviewing source code as an important part of the coding process.  The syllabus echoes this idea by the P2P Eval system where students have to peer review each other’s work after handing in every assignment.  Like a software company’s peer-review process, students must evaluate one another’s work honestly to provide fair critiques to the person being reviewed.</p>
<p>The syllabus also represents Mayuko’s idea that empathy is a big part of coding.  In the video, Mayuko explains that as software engineer, you need to have a certain level of empathy for the users, but also to your fellow engineers who you are collaborating on the project with.  Mayuko stresses that you need to be able to get along with them well and write your code in a way that they can understand.  In the same line of thinking, the syllabus requires that people stay for the duration of the class period and use the same equipment as everyone else.  As problem-solving is such a big part of computer science, you need to do your work in a way that is compatible with each person’s unique problem-solving strategies.</p>
<h2>Syllabus Amendments</h2>
<p>One thing I noticed that was greatly emphasized in the interview with Mayuko and not included in the syllabuses was that teamwork needs to happen not only amongst software engineers working on the code, but also with non-coders who are responsible for designing the end product.  While this is certainly difficult to implement in a computer science class, perhaps there could be an assignment that works with students from another heavy data-driven class like in the sciences or economics where the students create a project that combines both disciplines.  The non-coder should be responsible for collecting data and designing the overall goals of the project and the computer science student would have to work with them to portray the data in a way that supports whatever he/she would be trying to prove.</p>
<p>Additionally, while the syllabus contains many “soft-skill” elements as previously discussed, the course’s objectives do have any bullets pertaining to the development of such skills.  Perhaps one bullet point should read, “Students will learn utilize collaborative problem-solving techniques in a areas related to computer science and data visualization.” This would help to orient the class towards the collaborative method of problem solving that employers are looking for in graduates. </p>
