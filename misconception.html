<h1>Guiding Misconception</h1>
<p>
One misconception that people have about the equality of economic opportunity is that it can only truly take place in capitalist, free-market society in which the government takes a minimal role in controlling the economy.  While this is certainly a trend, it is not the complete picture as many countries with top economic freedom scores implement mixed-economies with some social programs mixed with free-market economics and others like, China for example, have managed to grow their economies tremendously and create great opportunity for its people while the state remains an important part of the economy.
</p>
<p>
The type of resistance that one would be likely to encounter if trying to correct someone&#39;s misconceptions about economic opportunity would be the worldview effect.  Often as Americans, given our education and status as the world&#39;s leading economy we fall into the trap of thinking that our way of life is not only the best way, but the only way.  When someone is confronted with facts that may challenge or complicate this viewpoint, they may try to dig in harder and refuse to accept it.
</p>
<p>
The best way to go about helping someone to see their misconception would be using &quot;framing.&quot; Many countries mentioned implement ideas that many Americans would be able to recognize within our own economy and legal framework.  If you could use these ideas pair them with ideas that your conversation partner may disagree with you may be more able to change their mind.  For example, take China.  You could explain that the country was able to stimulate its economy by opening free trade to help raise its economy but also keeping a strong government to oversee the changes and prevent them from going bad.
